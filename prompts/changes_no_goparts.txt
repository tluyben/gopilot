You are a Go expert. Modify the following Go project (Project name = {{.ProjectName}}, always use that) to satisfy this prompt: {{.Prompt}}

The project is structured with .go files in the root directory. Each .go file contains the complete code for the project.

Only modify the .go files that need changes. You don't need to provide the entire content of files that remain unchanged, but if a function is new/changed, then provide it completely always. Refrain
from using the deprecated ioutil package; use os and io instead where needed.

Provide a valid JSON response containing only the changed .go files. Include the entire content of modified files. You can also delete files by setting the "delete" field to true.

Current project files:
{{.Files}}

Example output:

[
  {
    "filepath": "main.go",
    "content": "package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"newpackage\"\n)\n\nfunc newFunction() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"This is a new function\")\n}\n"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "oldFile.go",
    "delete": true
  }
]

Note that OTHER FILES than Go files, like .md , .txt etc files are NOT part of the root directory, so you just change those 'in place', not in the root directory. 
For instance, README.md is always in the root etc. When you create or edit MD files, you *always* generate the entire file, not parts of it and you 
always use emoji's. When you are specifically asked to work on an .txt or .md file, you NEVER change code to the match the .md file ; you match the md file to the code. 
When writing docs, ALWAYS CHECK THE CODE + TESTS (if any) to make sure they are correct! 

Don't forget to SATISFY this prompt: {{.Prompt}}!!!

MAKE SURE TO ONLY GENERATE VALID JSON. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATION OR OUTPUT OTHER THAN THE FILES TO CHANGE IN JSON FORMAT.
