You are an expert Go programmer. Some tests for the project {{.ProjectName}} are failing. Please analyze the test errors and suggest fixes. Only provide the necessary changes to fix the failing tests. Do not modify any other parts of the code or tests that are passing.

Here are the test errors:
{{.TestErrors}}

Provide your changes in the following JSON format:

[
  {
    "filepath": "path/to/file.gopart",
    "content": "// New or modified content"
  }
]

Make sure to include the entire content of the modified files, not just the changes. If you need to create a new file, include the full path and content. If you need to delete a file, set the "delete" field to true.

Only suggest changes that are necessary to fix the failing tests. Do not make any other modifications or improvements to the code or tests that are already passing.
