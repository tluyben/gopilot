The following JSON is invalid. Please fix it so it matches the desired output format for file changes:

{{.RawChanges}}

The correct format should be a JSON array of objects, each with 'filepath' and 'content' fields. Here's an example of the correct format:

[
  {
    "filepath": "main.go",
    "content": "package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "README.md",
    "content": "# My Project\n\nThis is a sample README file.\n"
  }
]

IF THERE is context the JSON that's not complete then just CUT IT OFF: the main goal is to provide the JSON in the correct format!!!!

MAKE SURE TO ONLY GENERATE VALID JSON, DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY EXPLANATION OR OUTPUT THAN THE FILES TO CHANGE IN JSON!!!!! 
ONLY GENERATE COMPLETE FILES, NEVER EVER USE (rest of the code remains unchanged) OR (rest of the file remains unchanged) OR SIMILAR, OR PUT TODOs IN THE CODE; JUST WRITE ALL.
