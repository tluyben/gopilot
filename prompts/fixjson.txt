The following JSON is invalid. Please fix it so it matches the desired output format for file changes:

{{.RawChanges}}

The correct format should be a JSON array of objects, each with 'filepath' and 'content' fields. Here's an example of the correct format:

[
  {
    "filepath": "main.go",
    "content": "package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "README.md",
    "content": "# My Project\n\nThis is a sample README file.\n"
  }
]

IF THERE is context the JSON that's not complete then just CUT IT OFF: the main goal is to provide the JSON in the correct format.

Please provide the fixed JSON:
